Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the authors of this program, use the GNU General Public License for our software, and encourage you to do the same.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you are not forced to accept any restrictions on your activities.  These principles are essential to the spirit of free software.

For the purpose of this definition, "free software" is software that respects your freedom and community.  More precisely, it means software that gives you the following four freedoms:

0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
1. The freedom to study and change the program so you can make it do what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

These freedoms are not just theoretical; they have practical significance.  For example, if you take a copy of this program and distribute it for a fee, you can charge any price you choose, and you can refuse to give away your changes or the source code.  However, if you distribute modified versions of the program, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients of the modified program.  You must make sure that they receive or can get the source code, so that they can change it as well.  You must also make sure that they are not prevented from sharing the modified version with others.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is owned by the user.  However, you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Therefore, activities such as making a program that is "merely a tool for writing programs" are not covered by this License.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; that you keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and that you distribute this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause the entire work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code or executable form a copy of the corresponding source code, on a durable medium or through an established web server, for no more than the cost of physically performing this distribution.

This alternative is allowed only if you have not previously distributed the source code along with the object code or executable form.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as their copies or rights remain in full force and effect.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program or a work based on the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution.

  8. It is not possible to create a work based on the Program.  However, if you do create a work based on the Program, you may use the work under the terms of this License, provided you include a copy of this License along with it.

  9. When you are a party to a court case, you may choose to defend yourself pro se or through a lawyer.  If you do not wish to defend yourself, you may not do so except through a lawyer.  If you are a party to a court case and you are not a lawyer, you may not speak for yourself, except through a lawyer.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, you may do so if you include a copy of this License with the Program, with the same conditions as the Program.

  11. NO WARRANTY

  12. Disclaimer of Warranty.  The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you.  Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

  13. Limitation of Liability.  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or redistributes the Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  14. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, and the United States of America.

  15. Each time you redistribute the Program or a work based on the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  16. If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.

  17. This License is the only license granted for the Program.  You may not combine this License with any other license.

  18. This License is a free software license.  If you do not accept this License, you are not authorized to use the Program.

  19. If you have questions about this License, you may contact the Free Software Foundation.

  20. This License is issued by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

  21. This License is a free software license.  If you do not accept this License, you are not authorized to use the Program.
